# Return of the Dragon

---
## WIP text based RPG

An evil dragon lands in the city square in Eldoria. As you stand in the crowd, the dragon states his demand. He wants
the city to gather 10,000 gold by the time he returns in one month, or else the city will burn. As the dragon takes off,
the crowd begins to disperse and everyone goes about their day, seemingly unbothered by the dragon's warning. You decide
to find a way to either amass the gold the dragon is asking for, or perhaps find a way to gather allies and equipment
to slay the beast. It is now 12:00, August 1st. The dragon will return on September 1st. Your journey begins here...
